# jQuery AJAX & Express Checkpoint

This code challenge has a large amount of the functionality stubbed out for you:

* The front end has already been written!
* Some parts of the both the client and server code have been filled in for you!

This application will allow users to store cats on the server and retrieve those cats.

## TODOs

- [ ] In *client.js*, make an AJAX request that will add cats to the server.
- [ ] In *server.js*, create the server-side route that will send all cats to the client.
- [ ] In *server.js*, create the server-side route that will add a new cat object to the provided catData object.

**IMPORTANT:** Only write code where you see `@TODO` comments.

## Remember

- Install Node dependencies by running `npm install`.
- Start the server with `npm start`.
- Check your work by visiting `localhost:3000` in a browser and using the form to add new cats. Each time you submit a new cat, a new entry should appear in the list.
- In addition, you can run `npm test` to run the unit tests written for this app.

**IMPORTANT:** All of your changes should take place inside the *server.js* and *client.js* files. You don't need to edit any of the other files that are included in this challenge.

Good luck!
